# Principal Components Analysis (PCA) Implementations


## Introduction

This module presents an implementation of PCA in pure python^*.

PCA is dimension reduction technique. It examines correlations between variales and finds the underlying variables (known as principal components) that best differenciate the data points. Principal components are dimensions along which your data points are most spread out.

* only scipy is used to compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

## Motivation

The purpose of this exercice is to gain a complete understanding on how PCA work.

It is also a valuable exercice to practice python programming.

## Use

The only library required to run the script in python3 is scipy:

```
>>> python pca.py
```
